            <p>Deep, I have always been bad at expressing my feelings, be it you, my family or even me as a matter of fact.
                The problem I always faced was that I thought no-one actually cared about them, because that's exactly how
                everyone treated them when I tried to speak. The fact that I kept marinating into the same thought that on-one
                cared led me to lock myself up and create an assumption that it's better to shut the fuck up rather than express
                yourself and get made fun of.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>I was so busy being locked up that I didn't even notice that I already had someone in my life that actually loved me 
                unconditionally. I, don't think about my emotions, how I feel, I just play video games or code or watch something 
                until the thing I am feeling eventually goes away. This is how I have always operated since my very childhood.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                I realize the fact that I should have opened myself up to you without thinking twice, because there's no reason why you would
                ever make fun of me, take me for granted or anything else. Sadly I did take you for granted in the very begining of our relationship
                cause I couldn't understand the fact that this off of all the relationships I have had this one actually matters.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Deep, I love you in more ways than possible, more than I could ever dream to love anyone else. I am just insanely uncomfortable showing it. 
                I have spent my entire life being alone, in my childhood, in my early and late teens all of it. I never understood the point of making 
                an effort, and I am so sorry you've had to deal with that. I will continue to push myself further and make more and more efforts to get you
                to belive the fact that I am not the sore guy you think I am.
            </p>

                I am pushing my career to go further, spending all my freetime on the terminal clicking away hoping to make something that will leave a dent
                in my life and yours. More often than not the line between maintaing my relationship with you and everyone else gets blured with me working on 
                some project. I have convinced myself that all the work I am doing is for my parents and you more than it is for me. However I can't seem to 
                comprehend the fact that being there with you is much more valuable than being able to prodive monetary benifit but not my actual presence.
            </p>

            <p>When I was making this, I was on your instagram to see pictures I could use, the best ones you have, I came across this particular video.</p>
            <video src="./assets/img/deep-bubbly.mp4" loop="loop" controls="controls"></video>
            <hr />
            <p>It was late at night and as usual I was sleepy, just wanting to go to hit the hay, however, as soon as I watched this I was filled with happiness,
                the moment it was finished I caught myself with a huge grin on my face, I couldn't belive the fact that I have someone like you in my life.
                I see you and the things I feel is comprehensible. 
            </p>

            <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We think of our emotions like they’re these unique, personal phenomena, that no one has ever felt what we have felt. There is a basis in science for every emotion we feel. Anger, love. As an engineer, I know there’s nothing magical about what makes us feel something for someone else. But then I see you smile. Man, that cannot be science.</p></blockquote>

            <h3>At the end of the day, I just wanna say I love you and I wish you the happiest of life and nothing else. I am glad to be with you deep, the luckiest man alive!</h3>
